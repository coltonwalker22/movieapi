I learned a lot with this project!
A site that shows popular, now playing, and top rated movies on the home page.
Including a search bar to look up movies. Each movie has its own page with unique 
stats and description!
Me being a film buff, this movie API seemed the most intriguing! The styling looks rough, but it was important to learn API calls, contextProvider, useParams, and creating a search bar for movies. It was important to me to learn how to utilize data from an API.
I was most proud of figuring out how to get each movie its own page
with useParams! I was able to get the movies id by passaing as a param. I had to
use the slice method to get rid of the ":" in front of the ID.
With the ID, I passed the "newId" variable into my axios request,
thus able to make my API call for that specfic movie!
